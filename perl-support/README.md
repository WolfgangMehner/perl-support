README for perl-support.vim (Version 5.5pre) / April 21 2019

Perl Support implements a Perl-IDE for Vim/gVim. It has been written to
considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by
inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, code snippets, templates, and
POD documentation.  Reading perldoc is integrated.  Syntax checking, running a
script, running perltidy,  running perlcritics, starting a debugger and a
profiler can be done with a keystroke.  There are many additional hints and
options which can improve speed and comfort when writing Perl. Please read the
documentation.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.x.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
`doc/perlsupport.txt` or look up the documentation via:

      :help perlsupport-system-wide


(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `perl-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/.vim/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/.vim/perl-support/templates/Templates` if
    you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `perl-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip perl-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/.vim/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/.vim/doc/...
      $HOME/.vim/plugin/perl-support.vim

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/.vim/perl-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a Perl buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Perl -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/.vim/templates/perl.templates` to customize or add to
   your Perl template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.


(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `perl-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory
`$HOME/vimfiles/` (find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/vimfiles/perl-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive `perl-support.zip` to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip perl-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/doc/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/perl-support.vim

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/vimfiles/perl-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map `\ntw` inside a Perl buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Perl -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/vimfiles/templates/perl.templates` to customize or add to
   your Perl template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.

(2.6) Make sure the shell is set up correctly. The options 'shell',
   'shellcmdflag', 'shellquote', and 'shellxquote' must be set consistently.
   Compare `:help perlsupport-troubleshooting`.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and tags
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  Perl dictionary for keyword completion
  *  the Perl module list
  *  reading Perl documentation with integrated calls to perldoc
  *  removing the root menu
  *  using additional plug-ins

Actions differ for different modes. Please read the documentation:

      :help perlsupport

Any problems? See the TROUBLESHOOTING section at the end of the help file
`doc/perlsupport.txt`.

RELEASE NOTES
================================================================================

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 5.5pre
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The templates which are inserted into new files as file skeletons can be
  specified in the templates library, via the properties:
    `Perl::FileSkeleton::Script`, `Perl::FileSkeleton::Module`,
    `Perl::FileSkeleton::Test`,   `Perl::FileSkeleton::POD`
- Add configuration variable `g:Perl_Ctrl_d` to control the creation
  of the `CTRL+D` map.
- Minor changes.

Note: The filetype plug-ins have been moved, and are thus not loaded
automatically anymore. Copy them from `perl-support/rc` to `ftplugin`,
or add the commands there to your own filetype plug-ins.

Note: Some configuration for `*.t` and `*.pod` files has been removed.
See `perl-support/rc/customization.vimrc` for how to add them to your
configuration files.

ADDITIONAL TIPS
================================================================================

(1) You may want to use a central hidden directory for all your backup files
   (see also `rc/customization.vimrc`):

   1.1 Add the following line to `.vimrc` (see also rc/customization.vimrc ):

      set backupdir  =$HOME/.vim.backupdir

   1.2 Create `$HOME/.vim.backupdir`.

   1.3 Add the following line to your shell initialization file `~/.profile`:

      find $HOME/.vim.backupdir/  -name "*" -type f -mtime +60 -exec rm -f {} \;

   When you are logging in all files in the backup directory older then 60
   days (-mtime +60) will be removed (60 days is a suggestion, of course).
   Be shure to backup in shorter terms!

(2) gVim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
   (see mapping in file `customization.gvimrc`).

(3) gVim. Use tear off menus.

(4) Try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
   pointer is back from the menu entry).

(5) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
   right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster than
   moving a finger to the middle button (which is often a wheel).
